## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- A system with a x-server installed (Linux)
- Firefox installed

#### When using docker
- Only docker is required

#### When you dont use docker
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pythons pip


### Installing

#### Docker (Preferred)
**Make sure that you have docker installed**
**Make sure that you use a LINUX distribution as the host**
1. Clone the Repository

   ``` $ git clone https://github.com/ThoughtfulDev/EagleEye ```
2. ```
   $ cd EagleEye
   $ sudo docker build -t eagle-eye .
   ```
3. Now create a `known` folder and a `result` folder anywhere on your PC.
4. Put the images of the known person in the known folder.
5. Change the name of the person your are searching for in `entry.sh`
6. Start the container. **Make sure to edit the paths**:
```
sudo docker run -t --net=host --env="DISPLAY" \
                           --volume="$HOME/.Xauthority:/root/.Xauthority:rw"  \
                           -v  /path/to/known:/EagleEye/known \
                           -v  /path/to/result:/result \
                           -v /path/to/EagleEye/Repository/entry.sh:/entry.sh \
                           eagle-eye

```

The result should now be in `/path/to/result`

---

#### Automated Prerequisites Installation (If Docker doesn't work)
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThoughtfulDev/EagleEye/master/install.sh && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```

---

#### Manual Prerequisites Installation (If you are hardcore)

For **Debian** based Distros
```
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
$ sudo apt install git python3 python3-pip python3-dev
$ sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev libboost-all-dev build-essential cmake libffi-dev
$ git clone https://github.com/ThoughtfulDev/EagleEye
$ cd EagleEye && python3 -m pip install --user -r requirements.txt
$ python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade beautifulsoup4 html5lib spry
```

For **Arch**
```
$ sudo pacman -Syu
$ sudo pacman -S git python python-pip gtk3 boost cmake libffi
$ git clone https://github.com/ThoughtfulDev/EagleEye
$ cd EagleEye && python3 -m pip install --user -r requirements.txt
$ python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade beautifulsoup4 html5lib spry
```


If Firefox is installed, download the [latest release](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/latest) of the Geckodriver for you Architecture.

**If you get a `broken pipe` Error use Geckodriver Version 0.19.1.**

**Note: If you are using Firefox ESR (like Kali does) please use the Geckodriver Version 0.17.**

Make the Geckodriver executable:
```
$ chmod +x /path/to/geckodriver
```

Note: The `geckodriver` prefers to be in your path so wherever you do set it up you will likely need to setup a link to somewhere in your PATH (or add it to your PATH).

Example:
```
$ sudo ln -s /path/to/geckodriver /usr/local/bin/geckodriver
```
